# Covid 19 Vaccination and Cases Analysis
Investigation of the rates of vaccination around the world and factors that impact these rates.
### Covid 19 Vaccination and Cases Analysis (D. Cornea)

Covid 19 is a disease caused by a virus that easily spreads from person to person and affected people around the world since end of 2019. Data about the pandemic is available in different forms and it is updated every day.

The data source used for this Covid Cases analysis project is owid-covid-data.csv from the ourworldindata.org as well as the country_vaccinations.csv from kaggle.com.

According the the owid-covid-data on 15th December 2021 there were 272Mil cases recorded worldwide.

Countries with the highest number of cases include United States with 48Mil cases, India 34Mil and Brazil 22Mil.

![Highest_Cases](https://github.com/MSufra/Monash-Project-1/blob/main/DC%20Output/DC%20Figures/Fig%20DC%20Highest%20Number%20of%20Cases%20by%20Country.png)


During the time, the number of cases increased and decreased in waves with different peak periods for each country. 

![(New_Cases)](https://github.com/MSufra/Monash-Project-1/blob/189ad3e63aa096f67ba3b96cda4d4f08a2686aac/DC%20Output/DC%20Figures/Fig%20DC%20Box%20Plot%20New%20Cases%20Selected%20Countries.png)

From the data analysed the correlation between new cases and new vaccines or people fully vaccinated is very weak.

However, there is a strong positive correlation between the new cases and new deaths demonstrated by a r-squared of 0.71.

![(Deaths_vs_Cases)](https://github.com/MSufra/Monash-Project-1/blob/189ad3e63aa096f67ba3b96cda4d4f08a2686aac/DC%20Output/DC%20Figures/Fig%20DC%20New%20Deaths%20vs%20New%20Cases%20Worlwide%20-%20Linear%20Regression.png)

Vaccination data shows that the countries with the highest number of people vaccinated are India with 781MIL people vaccinated, United States 234.6MIL and Brazil 163MIL. However, China, India and United States are the countries with the highest number of people fully vaccinated. On the other hand, the countries with the highest percentage of population vaccinated are Gibraltar, United Arab Emirates and Portugal.

When analysing the data without considering other factors, the results show that in countries like Australia the number of cases increased when the fully vaccinated population increased also. However, there are other contextual factors to be considered before drawing a conclusion on the correlation between vaccine and new cases. These factors would include lockdowns, border closure, social distancing, and others.

While considering, India, a country with high number of cases, after analysing the trend of cases versus vaccination rate, it can be noted that the new cases increased sharply at end of April and decreased in May. However, the vaccination rate was rather low when the number of cases decreased, therefore it is unlikely that the vaccination rate affected the reduced number of new cases.



### GDP, Human Development Index and Life expectancy vs total amount of vaccinations (A. Rynkanen)

When comparing countries and their vaccination rates, differences of their socioeconomic status should be taken into consideration. In this dataset, the total number of vaccinations was compared to GDP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI) and life expectancy. 

When looking at the GDP per capita and the number of total vaccinations, moderate correlation can be observed. Based on the data, Pearson’s correlation coefficient for GDP per capita versus vaccination rate is 0.5. This means that higher GDP indicates higher vaccination rate. 

GDP  gives information about the size of the economy and how an economy is performing.  Higher GDP also gives an indication of how much governments can spend on public services, including health care. As the vaccine supply seems to be the main driver of the vaccination rates , higher vaccination rate requires e.g. good governance and high level of health care as well as the ability to either purchase different vaccines or manufacture them nationally. 

It is to be noted that GDP is not a measure of the overall standard of living. GDP growth does not tell how income is split across a population, and in this context, combined with data on vaccination rate does not alone describe well-being of a country. 

To emphasize other factors than economic growth, the United Nations computes a Human Development Index, which ranks countries based on life expectancy, literacy, and school enrolment. The Human Development Index  is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. 

When looking at the HDI and the number of total vaccinations, no correlation can be observed. Based on the data, Pearson’s correlation coefficient for HDI versus vaccination rate is 0.10. When looking at the life expectancy alone, weak correlation with total number of vaccinations can be observed. In this case, Pearson’s correlation coefficient is 0.31. This relationship, although weak based on this particular dataset, is observed as vaccinations lead to increased life expectancy . Also, generally, wealthier countries have a higher average life expectancy than poorer countries. This can be argued to be achieved through higher standards of living and more effective health care systems.

### Covid 19 Vaccine Manufacturer Analysis (M. Sufra)

As of the 11th of December 2021, there were eight vaccines, manufactured by eight different companies, against covid-19 approved for use by the World Health Organisation.
The data sets used for this project (country_vaccinations.csv from kaggle.com and vaccinations-by-manufacturer from Our World in Data) contains information on six of these vaccines, as well as information on the CanSino vaccine and the Sputnik V vaccine.

In the first data set of 223 countries the average number of vaccines approved for use was 3.2 and the most common number of approved vaccines was 4.
The countries with the most vaccines approved for use are Pakistan and Palestine with approval for 8 vaccines, however the upper bound in this data set was calculated to be 7, making these two countries outliers. The next highest approval number is 7, with 8 countries approving this many, while the lowest number of approved vaccines is 1 with 36 countries approving a single vaccine.
Plotting the number of vaccines approved in a country against the total number of vaccines administered per hundred people, as of 11th of December 2021, produces a scatter plot that appears to show no obvious correlation.

![Country_Vacciniations_Scatter](MS_Output/Country_Vacciniations_Scatter.png)

The line of regression appears almost horizontal and the Pearson's correlation coefficient is close to zero (0.0001) indicating that there is no correlation between number of vaccines approved in a country and the number of vaccinations administered.

The second data set records the number of vaccines administered by manufacturer in a selection of 39 countries. It is important to note that this data set does not include China where Sinovac and Sinopharm/Beijing are the most used vaccines and thus may bias the analysis against these two vaccines.
In these 39 countries Pfizer/BioNTech has been the most administered vaccine, accounting for 51.38% of all vaccines administered. Behind Pfizer/BioNTech is Moderna at 33.69% and after that all the other vaccines make up a much smaller part of vaccines administered in these countries.

![Manufacturer_Pie](MS_Output/Manufacturer_Pie.png)

Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson are all approved in over 30 of the 39 countries listed in the data set, while CanSino, Sinopharm/Beijing, Sinovac and Sputnik V are all approved in less than 10 of the 39.
When plotting this approval against the total number of vaccines administered from each manufacturer there appears to be a weak positive correlation.
![Vaccines_Approval_Scatter](MS_Output/Vaccines_Approval_Scatter.png)

The Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0.44 which indicates a weak to moderate correlation between the number of countries that have approved a vaccine and the number of doses administered. The lack of a stronger correlation may indicate that even though a vaccine may be approved in many countries there is still preference for certain manufacturers over others.


### Covid-19 Analysis, AUS NZ Comparison (S. Bhandari)
Observations and Analysis - Sonam B. 

Covid-19 is a contagious virus rapidly spreading within the large populus, first identified in November 2019. Data and datasets for this are evolving everyday with new information to hand constantly. 

Datasets for the below analysis are noted as below: 
- country_vaccinations.csv from Kaggle.com
- owid-covid-data.csv from the ourworldindata.org 

Since the spread of this virus being declared a pandemic, countries with larger population sizes have seen exponential numbers of infected, which on further look into the data also shows the same countries as higher on the vaccinated population as well. 

For the purpose of my analysis, a comparison has been undertaken between Australia and New Zealand considering the below factors: 
- Geographical location
- Similar demographic (though population size will vary) 
- GDP is in a similar range 
- Cultural similarities 

Analysis completed are however purely on the basis of dataset held - more focussed on the cases vs vaccination approach - with no further data sought or analysed on a breakdown of the populus. 

Observations suggest the following: 
- GDP is in the similar vicinity for both countries which stipulates stronger infrasture and health care support in administering more vaccinations

![Bar2](SB_Output/Bar2.png)

- Australia has recorded more deaths (>2000) on cases recorded than New Zealand.

![Bar1](SB_Output/Bar1.png)

- Australia is considerably ahead noting vaccinated population

![Bar](SB_Output/Bar.png)

- High correlation between total cases recorded and vaccination rates 
- Strong correlation between total covid cases and correspodning deaths recorded
- Also a moderate correlation between the case numbers increasing as more of the population gets vaccinated. 

Factors not considered:
- Border Closures
- Social distancing norms
- Lockdowns

In conclusion, 
As more variants are identified, more focus is being placed on vaccination boosters which will change the landscape as it is at present and the dataset as has been analysed will not be a real representation of all the updates that have been undertaken in the past month itself. 

Covid Cases are on a steep rise again; how the current trends fare in the coming months remains to be seen. 

What can be satisfactorily concluded is, countries with a higher GDP (though not a completed transparent view of their insfrasture or health care system) continue to manage and administer higher rates of vaccination. Pfizer is the preferred vaccine in 39 of the countries it has been approved in.
